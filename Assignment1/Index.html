            <div class="card-body"><p>My Idea for my website is going to also be my Senior Project. The idea behind the website is to make a place where people can go to find breeders of certain types of 
                purebred dogs. When people want to buy a purebred dog they usually go to facebook or craiglist. Instead of using one of those platforms I want to make one where breeders can make accounts and post pictures of dogs/puppies
            they have for sale/trade and give people looking for those dogs and easy way to find them. The website will have accounts and a messaging system</p> </div>
